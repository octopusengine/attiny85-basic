<b>From datasheet: </b><br />
The high-performance, low-power Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 8KB ISP flash memory, 512B EEPROM, 512-Byte SRAM, 
6 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, one 8-bit timer/counter with compare modes, 
one 8-bit high speed timer/counter, USI, internal and external Interrupts, 4-channel 10-bit A/D converter, 
programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, three software selectable power saving modes, 
and debugWIRE for on-chip debugging. The device achieves a throughput of 20 MIPS at 20 MHz and operates between 2.7-5.5 volts.<br />
By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the device achieves throughputs approaching 1 MIPS per MHz, 
balancing power consumption and processing speed.<br />
